            <h4>how Node JS works as a backend?</h4>
            <p>The Node JS Platform does not follow Request/Response Multi-Threaded Stateless Model. 
              It follows <b>Single Thread</b> concept with <b>Event Loop</b> Model, to handle multiple concurrent clients. 
              The Node JS Processing model is mainly based on <b>Javascript Callback mechanism</b>. 
              It utilizes less resources as compared to multi-threaded model.
              It is a good choice for building modern solutions based on Micro-services, event queues, jobs, and WebSockets.

            <h4>How it handle multiple requests from clients?</h4>
            <p>Node JS uses two concepts - <b>Asynchronous & Non-Blocking I/O</b>. A non-blocking call initiates the operation, 
              leaves it for the OS to complete returning immediately without any results. Asynchronous operations use callback functions, 
              and return results by creating a wait mechanism in a non-blocking operation.
              Modern approach uses <b>Async/await</b> technique, to avoid callback hells and handle promises (that involved function chaining).

            <h4>what is libuv?</h4>
            <p>A multiplatform Node JS library, built in <b>C language</b>, uses system kernel and implements <b>multiple threads</b>, 
              with the help of which Node JS uses multithreading indirectly. It highlights the following -</p>

              <li>File system events</li>
